  I am a mechanical design engineer. My specialty is to reduce complex problems to many simple tasks and solve them quickly. I enjoy playing table tennis in my spare time or playing board games with my friends. When the weather is excellent and, the wind is blowing, it's great a great time to go sailing. However, at home, I enjoy solving various tasks in Python. If you are curious about my recent work, look at my projects below.
