## Projects:
<br><br>

#### Parser for patent Office
<img src="images/patent_office_1.png?raw=true"/>
<br>
Up to twice, I speeded up the browsing of archived patents based on the grouping of the most relevant content in one pdf file.
The program is run from an exe file on windows or mac without installing external libraries. 

<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-pathology-2020-fgvc7">Plant Pathology 2020 - FGVC7</a>
#### Plant Pathology 2020 - FGVC7

<br>
Increasing accuracy of predictions by 59,6 % regarding on fast and simple computer vision model what was the first submission. Archived: Top 41% in kaggle competition.

#### Lunar lander
<img src="images/lunar_lander.gif?raw=true" width="360" height="270"/>
<br>
My team achieved second place in the meeting Deep learning Labs in Warsaw. We were able to train a model with the highest mean of scores but without the best result. 

#### Big mart sales prediction analysis
<img src="images/1.png" width="360" height="270"/>
<br>
Found features that have the greatest impact on predicting sales in large stores. Moreover, I tested effectiveness, several models, excluding less important features

#### Jira Script
<img src="https://almworks.com/assets/images/structure/structure_screenShot1.jpg?raw=true" width="360" height="270"/>
<!-- Image source https://almworks.com/ -->
<br>
Wrote a program that retrieves data from a script to learn Jira. Then after shuffling questions and answers, it prints the questions with answers in the console moreover it gives points after the correct answer. 

#### Heart disease UCI analisys
<img src="images/3.png" width="360" height="270"/>
<br>
Increased the rate of heart disease assessment from 54% to 82% with a standard deviation of 7% based on the weighted average of Precision and Recall.

#### PGA clustering
<img src="images/2.png" width="360" height="270"/>
<br>
I tested a hypothesis that, based on the number of the farthest bounces, will allow categorizing the golfers' style of play and tested the accuracy of the hypothesis by creating a ranking to compare with the play season ranking

#### Mushrooms clasifications
<img src="images/4.png" width="360" height="270"/>
<br>
Achieved 100% assessment using recall metric. This was possible due to a small number of examples without measurement errors.
**This learned model may only be a suggestion whether the mushroom found in the forest is edible. Also, it is much easier to confuse a feature in a young mushroom.

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-competitions/kaggle/15062/logos/header.png?t=2019-06-20-21-54-47&quot"/>
<!-- Image source https://www.kaggle.com/ -->
<br>
I created enough stable neural network system based on GAN, which began to generate low-resolution images of dogs of different breeds. Archived: Top 69% in Kaggle competition.
